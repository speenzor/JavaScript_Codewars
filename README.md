# JavaScript Codewars
Solutions to Codewars Challenges in JavaScript for Practice

I am now learning JavaScript as quickly as possible. To learn the basic syntax I've completed the Codecademy Pro JavaScript course. I'm not ready to start learning by doing, so I will be using Codewars and personal projects to further my JavaScript development. I will also be learning React.js with the same progression through Codecademy then personal projects.
